# To-Do List

## High Priority
- [ ] Fix ephemeral word fading feature - words should progressively fade as approaching the limit (last 5 words of limit cause first 5 words to fade)

## Lower Priority
- [ ] Fix cursor restoration after word limit modal (currently loses cursor position)
- [ ] Fix command modal positioning on empty lines (still appearing at top-left in some cases)
