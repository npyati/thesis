# What is this for?

I wanted a way to write with focus and without distractions. There are plenty of other apps that do this, but none that was exactly what I was looking for. Some of the features that I really wanted were:

- **Keyboard-driven interface.** You should be able to use this app entirely without using the mouse/trackpad.
- **Typewriter mode.** This mode only allows typing forward, not deleting or changing - like a typewriter. I find that this forces me to think abot the next thing I'm going to write and let the words come out with out worrying about whether what I've written is polished or not.

_More to come_
